        "To put it in a concise and simple message: You deserved better. You deserved a better pastor and elders. You deserved better Christian School Administrators and teachers. You deserved a better Youth Minister (Me). You deserved better behaving parents. (Me again) In your most difficult time of life, adolescence, we failed you. Most of us put our personal pleasures and fears above those of family and either ignored the young people in our lives and left the scene of the hopeless mess we helped create and ran toward self preservation. You, the real individuals and youth of our church, you really did deserve better. I am so sorry.",
        "I am not going to make excuses or try to unravel or justify my actions or the actions of others. What is done is done.",
        "If I could I would offer you a big eraser to wipe part of your life away and replace it with something beautiful and satisfying. I cannot. Your memories and perceptions are yours and yours alone. Only you, God, and time can give you the perspective to properly view your past. Some of you have already done this, most have partially done this, some have just dulled the pain.",
        "I am so sorry for all of you, we failed you. You deserved better."

        "Dear former CCCS students and children of CCBTC,",
        "I married Danny O’Brien at a Friday evening service at Community Chapel, on February 13, 1976. There were several other couples married during that service. I was 19 and Dan, 32 years of age. My pre-marriage counseling consisted of two brief meetings with Barbara Barnett in the back of the sanctuary. Dan met with Don Barnett, once. Think about what I have just stated! It is utterly absurd! My family howled in protest, but I’d already been conditioned not to listen to them.",
        "I cannot explain why I did not see the blatant disregard and dishonor for marriage and therefore family relationships, evident even then!",
        "I can only shudder, as I imagine the day-to-day experience of many of you, born to young parents who’d been steeped in those wicked presuppositions, evident even in 1976. Not to mention the addition of “disciplines” from Community Chapel Christian School!",
        "Dan and I had no children, but please forgive me for not perceiving your plight and fighting for you!",
        "From the very beginning of my life with Danny O’Brien, it was made abundantly clear that “ministry” (however that was defined) trumped the importance of marriage and family, without exception. That too, was a clear picture of what would develop later into the “spiritual connection” movement which would hurt especially you, the children, so deeply!",
        "I am so sorry, that as an elder’s wife, I did not perceive and or discover your hideous plight, and fight for you, then! Please forgive me. I was truly deceived, but that does not take away your pain or the damage you received at the hands of these horrid beliefs which were manifested through adults in the name of Christ!!",
        "I worked in the CCBTC counseling center from its inception (circa 1986), until early May, 1988. I recall counseling sessions where I blindly gave “advice” that was tainted with the accepted, but wicked, dishonor for marriage and family. For this I am deeply sorry. Please forgive me for this. I have written letters of repentance to specific individuals over the years or spoken to those I blindly misled. But, to you… the children whose parents I may have influence or “advised”, I now specifically apologize.",
        "At this point it is appropriate that you know: I had no knowledge of disciplinary abuses in Christian School or within families; no knowledge of the practice of sexual intercourse between “connections” that was pawned off as a righteous spiritual experience! I had no knowledge of sexual abuses or abortion being advised or worse yet, paid for by CCBTC. I had no knowledge of law suits against the church except one from Don Barnett. I was unaware that my deranged husband, Danny O’Brien, intended to split the church for Don Barnett on that fateful Friday in February, 1988. Church security had advised me that he may try to come to the sanctuary and that they were on alert to stop and question him. He was rarely home at that point and I was not allowed to ask him anything about his activities.",
        "You have every right to ask me why I did not perceive that these hideous practices were happening all around me. Believe me, since Leah and Lori shared some of your stories with me (anonymously, of course), that question has “stared me in the face”, continuously! I am without a conclusive answer for you, but this is what I do know:",
        "I was deceived…trapped by fear of disobeying or challenging anyone in authority, for the fear of thereby, disobeying God. I had imbibed countless sermons on authority and submission in marriage and relative to church leaders. My own marriage developed into a hell-hole of neglect, threats and eventually slugs to my head, when I refused to give Dan confidential information about one of his “connections”.",
        "I am so sorry that I did not see your pain and respond to help you. I contributed to your suffering in my ignorant endorsement of practices that led to your neglect, mistreatment and shame. Please forgive me!",
        "After 25 years of being single, 25 years of insomnia and nightmares, 25 years of restoring my conscience to God’s standards, 25 years of forgiving and being forgiven, I married Leah and Lori’s wonderful father, Richard. I do have a sense of what my being deceived cost each of you. In an effort to be properly accountable for my actions and lack of action, I submit this letter to each of you and pray for the love and restoration you deserve."

        "I want to express my heartfelt sorrow and grief for the wrongs you were subjected to during your young lives there.",
        "The terrible abuses and betrayals you have exposed are extremely disturbing, and I truly hurt for every one of you! I am greatly saddened and disturbed to discover that so many people I went to church with were being abused in so many different ways! I wish I had known then the depth and scope of what was happening so I could have prevented the crimes done to you and the hurts you experienced.",
        "I have had two friends tell me of two separate incidents. The first incident was the pastor brushing his hand against my friend's chest area when they danced. The other was sexual abuse committed by another leader of the church. Even though both friends asked me not to say anything, I reported both incidents, trusting that they would be handled correctly. If you would like further confirmation of these reports, feel free to privately message me.",
        "These gross offenses should have NEVER happened to you! These were adults you trusted—adults in leadership positions who should have been protecting you. I am sickened and grieved by the news and embarrassed by my naïveté of the evil happening in what was supposed to be a safe place.",
        "It devastates me to think about the battles and struggles you've faced (and continue to face) and the confusion, fear, and mistrust plaguing you still. Please forgive me for my ignorance and for unwittingly supporting such a destructive practice. I'm embarrassed and regretful that I was ever a part of the church & Bible college.",
        "Please forgive me if I have offended any of you in any way. It was not my heart or intention to hurt anyone. I'd lay my life down in an instant to protect all of you! I am so proud of your courage to speak out against the abuse and share your painful wounds with the world. I am glad you have found a safe place to meet and open up about the wrongs committed against you. I am praying that you and your families will find the healing, comfort, and restoration God desires for you and that you deserve! If there is ANYTHING I can do for you, please let me know!",

        "Thanks so much for sharing the letter from the kids (still kids to me) from CCCS. I was a part of the fb site when David H shared and it really affected me, in fact I began to rethink again about what happened, and that is not something I do much. I was able to read some of what was happening, and it I sensed a purpose in the amazing avalanche of sharing that it began. I am sure there is much healing, tears and forgiving occurring.",
        "As for myself, I would like to apologize for any part I may have played in harming or hurting any one of you. While nothing specific comes to mind that I did, I was a teacher and my acts of ignorance most certainly harmed some of you. If I did hurt anyone, please let me know so I can apologize for any specific act I committed. I know I am not without blame, I made many mistakes during those days and I regret them, and I know I should have “known better” than many of the things I did and things I turned my head to. I will say, I had no idea that parents were doing some of the things you all have mentioned, but I should have. I was so centered on my own pain that I neglected to see those who were right in front of my nose and needed me. Sometimes I look back and think, 'How on earth was I so dumb?' I believe we were in a cult and I am so sorry for any overt or covert acts I may have done to hurt you, including not protecting you. You all deserved better. I am so proud of each and every one, even those of you whom I did not know.",
        "I myself suffered from PTSD after I left, and I like many of you lost most of what I had; my family, church, home, husband, support, finances, friends, stability, and much more. But I was the grown up and I should have known better than to get myself in such a circumstance. Looking back, I am ashamed that I did not do more to put an end the ridiculous things that were going on. I can say that a lot of the judgmental attitudes I had until then were wiped out of my life as a result of me seeing my own humanity. I am happy to say that I have been on the road to recovery since I left, not that it was easy nor is my recovery complete, but those past traumas no longer rule my life. And I believe that this new openness you all are experiencing may also be a part of many others recovery including the 'adults', as there are still many of them who need healing as well. Perhaps we who were adults then will learn from what you are doing. After all, we were the grownups and I think you need to hear from us that we admit and repent from our selfishness and stupidity. I know I am truly sorry, please forgive me.",
        "I am sure it may be hard for some of you to believe, but many of us who were adults came to the chapel because we were hungry for more of God and we thought it would be a good thing for our families. Somehow, and unfortunately, we got lost along the way and many of you got lost as well, to no fault of your own. I long for restoration for each and every one of you and I know it is possible. Please feel free to contact me if you need to. You really are important.",
        "Again, you are all so amazing.",

        "I just learned of this Facebook page, and Lisa told me that there has been such honest and genuine sharing and insightful processing of what you all experienced at CCBTC. My heart was broken to hear of what everyone has gone through, and I am grateful that you have found each other in a safe place! As a former leader, I am so sorry for every way I contributed to your injuries, even devastation in some cases, because of your time at CCBTC. I know some of you more than others, and carry a deep sorrow of heart for the defenseless onslaught so many of you endured during those formative years.",
        "Our initial experiences at CCBTC in 1967 and on was of finding wonderful people, being involved in exciting preaching of the gospel and in lives being transformed by God, and having amazing times of worship. I have great memories with people from CCBTC, but that is not what this post is about.",
        "For years, I was not aware that underneath, there was a culture of pride, of elitism, of self-righteousness, of aloofness and criticalness of all other churches. We were isolated from outside influences and lacked accountability to anyone; it was a system of domination and control, leading to a counter culture. On many levels, it was an unhealthy place. It was an unhealthy place for Jan and I to raise our children.",
        "And tragically, that culture seeded itself in a horrific, twisted false doctrine. Once “connections” took off, they caused devastation to individuals, families, but especially to you, the children. I am still so sorry about my involvement in connections and what it did to my wife, my girls, and the people at CCBTC. It created such trauma that many have suffered over the years, many even with PTSD.",
        "Everyone’s experiences were different depending on many things. But age was a huge factor. You kids should have been openly celebrated and served, as Jesus taught, instead of being treated as an obstacle to the adults experiencing a “move of God.” So many of you were abandoned both emotionally and physically at a time when you most needed love and acceptance and security. As children, you didn’t have the coping skills that you do now. You needed adults who would protect you and care for you, that you could trust. I am so sorry I did not do my part to make sure you had that! Through tears, I am writing this.",
        "Being involved as an elder in deliverance and connections sent the message that I approved of what was going on. And some said to us, “We are still here because of you and Jan and your example to us.” Possibly some of those people were your parents. I am so sorry! I am so very sorry that my actions may have caused you further damage! So many atrocities came to light at the time of the split, and I have subsequently learned much more of what happened to you all. I am just sick that I was ever part of such a system.",
        "Before the elders asked Jan & I to leave, God had revealed to me, in an instant, one day, the hideous deception we were in. I was crushed! I had bought into it! And I had undoubtedly led others to buy into it. It is a grief for Jan & I to this day. But with His judgement came mercy. I repented first to Jan, then to each of our girls. And then to others as there was opportunity. On that day, the Lord spoke directly to me three specific things. 1. Go back to your family. 2. Get out of the ministry. 3. I want to grind this system to powder and scatter the people to other churches to be healed.",
        "It has been a long journey for us. Various ministries and counselors have brought us healing, truth, and comfort. But the ache and pain of heart are always nearby. Our family has gone through various stages of pain/devastation/abandonment/denial/anger/grief/healing. There is always hope.",
        "I am so glad you are finding a safe place to express what very few people would fully understand. A festering wound must be opened in order to heal; it takes a lot of courage to do so, and it can be messy.",
        "Thank you, Logan, for starting this site. Thank you, Jesus, who gives beauty for ashes. And thank you, each one of you, for sharing your journey."
