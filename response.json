				"I just learned of this Facebook page, and Lisa told me that there has been such honest and genuine sharing and insightful processing of what you all experienced at CCBTC. My heart was broken to hear of what everyone has gone through, and I am grateful that you have found each other in a safe place! As a former leader, I am so sorry for every way I contributed to your injuries, even devastation in some cases, because of your time at CCBTC. I know some of you more than others, and carry a deep sorrow of heart for the defenseless onslaught so many of you endured during those formative years.",
				"Our initial experiences at CCBTC in 1967 and on was of finding wonderful people, being involved in exciting preaching of the gospel and in lives being transformed by God, and having amazing times of worship. I have great memories with people from CCBTC, but that is not what this post is about.",
				"For years, I was not aware that underneath, there was a culture of pride, of elitism, of self-righteousness, of aloofness and criticalness of all other churches. We were isolated from outside influences and lacked accountability to anyone; it was a system of domination and control, leading to a counter culture. On many levels, it was an unhealthy place. It was an unhealthy place for Jan and I to raise our children.",
				"And tragically, that culture seeded itself in a horrific, twisted false doctrine. Once “connections” took off, they caused devastation to individuals, families, but especially to you, the children. I am still so sorry about my involvement in connections and what it did to my wife, my girls, and the people at CCBTC. It created such trauma that many have suffered over the years, many even with PTSD.",
				"Everyone’s experiences were different depending on many things. But age was a huge factor. You kids should have been openly celebrated and served, as Jesus taught, instead of being treated as an obstacle to the adults experiencing a “move of God.” So many of you were abandoned both emotionally and physically at a time when you most needed love and acceptance and security. As children, you didn’t have the coping skills that you do now. You needed adults who would protect you and care for you, that you could trust. I am so sorry I did not do my part to make sure you had that! Through tears, I am writing this.",
				"Being involved as an elder in deliverance and connections sent the message that I approved of what was going on. And some said to us, “We are still here because of you and Jan and your example to us.” Possibly some of those people were your parents. I am so sorry! I am so very sorry that my actions may have caused you further damage! So many atrocities came to light at the time of the split, and I have subsequently learned much more of what happened to you all. I am just sick that I was ever part of such a system.",
				"Before the elders asked Jan & I to leave, God had revealed to me, in an instant, one day, the hideous deception we were in. I was crushed! I had bought into it! And I had undoubtedly led others to buy into it. It is a grief for Jan & I to this day. But with His judgement came mercy. I repented first to Jan, then to each of our girls. And then to others as there was opportunity. On that day, the Lord spoke directly to me three specific things. 1. Go back to your family. 2. Get out of the ministry. 3. I want to grind this system to powder and scatter the people to other churches to be healed.",
				"It has been a long journey for us. Various ministries and counselors have brought us healing, truth, and comfort. But the ache and pain of heart are always nearby. Our family has gone through various stages of pain/devastation/abandonment/denial/anger/grief/healing. There is always hope.",
				"I am so glad you are finding a safe place to express what very few people would fully understand. A festering wound must be opened in order to heal; it takes a lot of courage to do so, and it can be messy.",
				"Thank you, Logan, for starting this site. Thank you, Jesus, who gives beauty for ashes. And thank you, each one of you, for sharing your journey."

				"It took 30 years for the kids to grow up and to find their voice. I hope they are truly head! This is not an end, it is a beginning...",
				"The fact that this has happened is truly profound and what they are revealing is exactly what our generation needs to hear and begin to deal with all the realities of what chapel truly was and for the most part still is...",
				"This is not a revival or a 'healing of the chapel'...these are the stories of each and every kid that where victims of our huge deception. The deception and pious arrogant attitudes are still practiced by many parents to this day.",
				"Fifteen years ago I began a search for whatever happened to those I knew at the chapel ...what I found and encountered was very sad, people who were still deeply into chapels and would attack anyone who counted them. Fast forward to today and you find two differs facebook pages on for those recovering from CC and one for those who have 'moved on' yet still carry the torch...",
				"Don Barnett got attention his whole life...people created a distraction from the abuse they helped create and swept the casualties under the rug. Recovery truly is starting now and it is the children who are leading the way...not the other way around by our highly esteemed past leaders who are still put on pedestals. The time has come for true repentance and those in leadership to step up and own what they did...no excuses or preaching...remember what choices you made that got us to this point in life.",
				"Steady On Kids ! I am proud of you ...you make my eyes leak!",
				"Parents back of and don't slather chapel religiosity all over the place that stuff is toxic and it needs to be called out when it happens.",
				"Many of us are still traumatized by what we went thru at CC...we didn't take the easy route of denial, we did not follow the flocks as the moved on with their chapel lives. Many who did follow the flock are just now staring to see that it was not moving on at all but simply holding on to something they believed in..yet it is still just as destructive...we will not recover by the same thinking that got us here...",
				"There is a new freedom to be had but there is much work to be done to get there...It is too late for some, lives ended because of what chapels did to them...there are lives hanging by a thread to this day, be careful what you say you wise little chapel men on a soapbox and those who support them..."

				"Thanks so much for sharing the letter from the kids (still kids to me) from CCCS. I was a part of the fb site when David H shared and it really affected me, in fact I began to rethink again about what happened, and that is not something I do much. I was able to read some of what was happening, and it I sensed a purpose in the amazing avalanche of sharing that it began. I am sure there is much healing, tears and forgiving occurring.",
				"As for myself, I would like to apologize for any part I may have played in harming or hurting any one of you. While nothing specific comes to mind that I did, I was a teacher and my acts of ignorance most certainly harmed some of you. If I did hurt anyone, please let me know so I can apologize for any specific act I committed. I know I am not without blame, I made many mistakes during those days and I regret them, and I know I should have “known better” than many of the things I did and things I turned my head to. I will say, I had no idea that parents were doing some of the things you all have mentioned, but I should have. I was so centered on my own pain that I neglected to see those who were right in front of my nose and needed me. Sometimes I look back and think, 'How on earth was I so dumb?' I believe we were in a cult and I am so sorry for any overt or covert acts I may have done to hurt you, including not protecting you. You all deserved better. I am so proud of each and every one, even those of you whom I did not know.",
				"I myself suffered from PTSD after I left, and I like many of you lost most of what I had; my family, church, home, husband, support, finances, friends, stability, and much more. But I was the grown up and I should have known better than to get myself in such a circumstance. Looking back, I am ashamed that I did not do more to put an end the ridiculous things that were going on. I can say that a lot of the judgmental attitudes I had until then were wiped out of my life as a result of me seeing my own humanity. I am happy to say that I have been on the road to recovery since I left, not that it was easy nor is my recovery complete, but those past traumas no longer rule my life. And I believe that this new openness you all are experiencing may also be a part of many others recovery including the 'adults', as there are still many of them who need healing as well. Perhaps we who were adults then will learn from what you are doing. After all, we were the grownups and I think you need to hear from us that we admit and repent from our selfishness and stupidity. I know I am truly sorry, please forgive me.",
				"I am sure it may be hard for some of you to believe, but many of us who were adults came to the chapel because we were hungry for more of God and we thought it would be a good thing for our families. Somehow, and unfortunately, we got lost along the way and many of you got lost as well, to no fault of your own. I long for restoration for each and every one of you and I know it is possible. Please feel free to contact me if you need to. You really are important.",
				"Again, you are all so amazing.",
				"Blessings, Ruthie Skube Hamill"
